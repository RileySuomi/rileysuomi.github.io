            Hey, I'm Riley Suomi 
        </p>
        <p>
            I am actively a Junior pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a minor in Data Analytics, 
            from Seattle Pacific University. I came into this major with little to no experience with coding, which 
            made for a challenging first year of learning the ropes, yet I embraced the oppurtunity to go through struggle. And thanks to 
            achieving a large amount of college credits in high school, I have been fortunate enough to really focus on the major 
            related courses and have been able to pick up other courses of interest, leading me with the intention to graduate comfortably in June 2025.
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout this journey, I've discovered a passion for coding and the ultimate feeling of seeing product being created beneath
            my very fingertips. From learning the basics to diving into more advance algorithms/concepts, every piece are like little puzzles 
            to solve. My work to learning these skils has been unwavering, driving me to continue to dive deeper into a world of endless possibilities
            and innovation. Coding really comes with being more than just a skill; it's a show of creativity, a tool for problem-solving, and opens 
            limitless oppurtunities.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the rest of my journey, looking forward, I envision this passion to lead me through meaningful software development roles that continue to help me 
            grow this passion and develop as a person. As these oppurtunities happen, I plan to update this site. But for now you can see projects I have worked on 
            so far in my <a href="portfolio.html"><span class="inline-stuff">portfolio section</span>.</a>

            While my education and coding journey have been integral parts of my life, there's more to me than my academic and professional pursuits. 
            When I'm not preoccupied in lines of code or textbooks, you'll often find me indulging in hobbies and interests. Beyond the screen I am a very social person, 
            and I thrive with enjoying activities in groups of friends whether it's watching sporting events, going out on adventures, board games, various pickup sporting events
            or maybe I am still on the screen gaming. These activities not only welcome a break to the brain from grinding work but fulfill a positive emotion of
            peer engagement, allowing for me to recharge and keep a healthy work-life balance. 
        </p>
        <p>
            As I grew up in a small outdoorsy town in the state of Washington, I was blessed with the ability to be able to grow up surrounded by forests, rivers, and small mountains.
            So comes forth, one of my greatest passions/appreciations is the outdoors and hiking. There's something truly magical about the sense of freedom and adventure in hiking. 
            Nothing compares to the profound connection with nature and the beauty in which He has created. Whether summiting up to a peak to see sunset or treking through a forest in 
            the misty rain, the outdoors beckons withs its timeless beauty. Which has really ignited me with the hope to be able to travel and experience as much of the 
            awh-inspiring scenes Earth has to offer as I willingly can.  
        </p>
        <p>
            And since this is my little corner of the internet, I hope to have it feel personalized towards me with and below I would like to share images that I have taken and is something I plan to continue to add and update.
